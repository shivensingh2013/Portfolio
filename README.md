## List of projects in the website

1) (BOSCH) Image to Image Translation - Bosch Project - Designed a Interactive UI based solution called PACE to feed in image and text to generate a domain adapted image using our novel MAE+ GAN methodology
   
2) (BOSCH) AIBSE- Semantic Document Search Engine - Developed a product within Bosch to retrieve historical textual requirements from given current requirements using Attention based algorithms
   
3) New cloth design generation - Build a vanilla diffusion model from scratch to generate new clothes style at inference.
   
4) Hand sign recognizer - This project is able to use the camera feed and generate prediction of the number shown by the human via hand sign.

5) Bird Eye view from Camera Images  - This projects implements a IPM based method to stich together 4 / 6 images given by the user and provide a BIRD eye view.Additionally , we feed in camera intrinsic and extrinsic properties to improve the stitching quality. 
   
6) On Device Image segmentation - Build a pipeline for consuming a YUV image stream coming from camera ( car dashboard ) and displaying its semantic segmentation on a monitor (YUV format) . This project was built on CPP environment.
